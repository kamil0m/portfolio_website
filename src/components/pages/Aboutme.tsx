        <p>I am a passionate web developer with a background in linguistics and a keen interest in technology. With a solid foundation in languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and experience in frameworks such as React and Bootstrap, I am currently focused on expanding my skills in front-end design. My academic journey, which includes a Master's in French Linguistics and extensive studies in Philology, has honed my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Trilingual in Polish, French, and English, I excel in cross-cultural communication and enjoy collaborating on innovative projects that bridge the gap between language and technology.</p>
